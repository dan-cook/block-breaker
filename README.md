# Block Breaker Demo

This is a simple demo of a breakout style game written in Godot 4. Although I found many basic tutorials online, I could not find an up to date one nor one that went for a simple approach. This code is not pretty, nor is it organised but then there isn't really much to organise, comments will also tell you what everything's doing.


## Feature list:

- [x] Ball physics
- [x] Breakable blocks
- [x] Basic UI scoring
- [ ] Start button
- [ ] Pause/resume gameplay
- [ ] Player lives
- [ ] Game Over / Retry
- [ ] Background music & gameplay sounds


## Improvements / future ideas to expand on:
 - Multiple levels
 - Save state (progress, high score)
 - Varied blocks (more health, different shapes, etc)
 - Block placement (level design) in-code rather than placed by hand
 - Endless mode where levels are randomly generated with increased difficulty
 - Powerups or other temporary player abilities
